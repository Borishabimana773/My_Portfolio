                        <p>
                            My name is Boris Habimana, I am a seasoned professional with experience in customer service, sales
                            project management in telecom and financial services. In my time in financial services, I worked in 
                            various roles including working with IT department to develop new products and services. This provided me
                            with the knowledge of both frontend and backend operations and management.
                            I am currently open to opprtunities to join a team that is working to make the world a better place.
                            With my newly acquired fullstack webdeveloper skills, I would love to combine it with my customer and non-customer facing
                            experience to improve and deliver cutting-edge solutions that will solve ever increasing challenges such as caused by Covid-19.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am married to my wonderful wife and together,we are raising our now five year old son who means the world to us. Having been born 
                            in East-Africa, I was fortunate to be exposed to many cultures which instilled in me values such as: care for others, integrity, honesty,
                            courage and hope. I have travelled around Africa and many parts of the world, I have worked with teams and have been part of projects cross-continental.
