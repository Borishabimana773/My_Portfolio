                        <p>
                            My name is Boris Habimana, I am a seasoned professional with experience in customer service, sales
                            project management in various industries such as in telecom and financial services. In my time in financial services, I worked in 
                            different roles including working with IT and commercial departments to develop new products and services. This provided me
                            with the knowledge of both frontend and backend operations and management.
                            I am currently open to opprtunities to join a team that is working to make the world a better place.
                            With my newly acquired fullstack web developer skills, I would love to combine it with my customer and non-customer facing
                            experience to improve and deliver cutting-edge solutions that will solve ever increasing challenges such as caused by Covid-19.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I am married to my wonderful wife and together,we are raising our now five year old son who means the world to us. Having been born 
                            in East-Africa, I was fortunate to be exposed to many cultures which instilled in me values such as: care for others, integrity, honesty,
                            courage and hope. I have travelled around Africa and many parts of the world, I have worked with teams and have been part of projects cross-continental.
